# 📘 DS-Problems

Welcome to **DS-Problems** 🚀

This repository is a **collection of Data Structure problems and solutions** using C/C++. It focuses on implementing key data structures and solving real problems with clean, readable code.

Whether you’re learning data structures for the first time or preparing for competitive programming and interviews, this repo gives you hands-on practice with core concepts.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Understand **data structures in action**
* Practice problem-solving with real code
* Connect theory with implementations
* Prepare for coding interviews and contests
* Build confidence with structured coding habits

This repository is **practice-first**, with clarity and correctness as priorities.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tauhidrana/DS-Problems.git
```

2. Navigate to the folder you want:

```bash
cd DS-Problems/Stack
```

3. Compile a file:

```bash
g++ stack_demo.cpp -o stack_demo
```

4. Run it:

```bash
./stack_demo
```

Change file names based on the problem you want to explore.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

* Understand *why* a structure works before learning *how* it works
* Write readable code before optimizing
* Solve many problems rather than memorizing syntax
* Debug actively to build intuition

Data structures are not just code—they’re ways of thinking.

## 📌 Notes

* Solutions focus on clarity over performance
* This is a **learning repository**, not a production library
* Directory structure keeps similar problems grouped

## 🤝 Contribution

Contributions are welcome:

* Add new problem solutions
* Improve logic and readability
* Provide clear explanations or comments
* Organize problem categories
